title: Peer Supporters
---
Peer Supporters are trained by the University Counselling Service as an
impartial ear for anyone in college to talk to about absolutely anything.

Oxford is permanently high-stress and if there are things bothering you
everything can very quickly get on top of you. Sometimes you can feel you
are burdening your friends, or that you just don’t want them to know about
a particular issue; perhaps you feel your problem isn't 'serious' enough
that you need to go to a senior member of college and yet it's still
worrying; perhaps you want to talk to someone who doesn't know you just to
get something off your chest.

You dictate the terms; you can talk for as long as you like, whenever you
like, about whatever you like. Most importantly, Peer Support is
confidential, we don't judge or instruct, and people really do approach us
with problems big and small.

You can email, you can phone, you can come to their rooms for tea –
use this excellent service!
