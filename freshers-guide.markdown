title: Fresher's Guide
---

There are many guides available for new students in Oxford. Different
versions are provided by OUSU (the Oxford University Student Union), the
faculties, the colleges, the common rooms, and other organisations. As
there is plenty of information out there, we did not try to make a
comprehensive document. However, we designed this guide to focus on two
things: first, on what we think are the most important and urgent things
for new students to know and do and, second, on the little details that we
wish we knew as new students, and which in our opinion can make all the
difference.
