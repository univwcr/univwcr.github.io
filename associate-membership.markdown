There is a constitutional procedure to follow should anyone wish to apply for Associate Membership.
Here is a list of those who can apply for Associate Membership:

* Graduate research workers who are not members of a college
* Recognised students who do not qualify for ordinary membership of any other MCR in the university
* Spouses and long-term partners of ordinary members
* Fourth-year undergraduates of Exeter College

If you would like to apply, here is the procedure (as detailed in the MCR Constitution):

1. Two people must nominate the individual and email the Vice-President of the MCR 1 week before a general meeting. These are usually held in 8th week.
2. Prepare a written statement as to why you have requested to be an associate member. This will be read out at the meeting.
3. Simple majority vote determines whether you are accepted.

For the academic year 2007-08, you must pay the MCR a fee of Â£62.16. Similar fees apply in consequent years.
